    "abstract": "Advancements in optical satellite hardware and lowered costs for satellite launches raised the high demand for geospatial intelligence. The object recognition problem in multi-spectral satellite imagery carries dataset properties unique to this problem. Perspective distortion, resolution variability, data spectrality, and other features make it difficult for a specific human-invented neural network to perform well on a dispersed type of scenery, ranging data quality, and different objects. UNET, MACU, and other manually designed network architectures deliver high-performance results for accuracy and prediction speed in large objects. However, once trained on different datasets, the performance drops and requires manual recalibration or further configuration testing to adjust the neural network architecture. To solve these issues, AutoML-based techniques can be employed. In this paper, we focus on Neural Architecture Search that is capable of obtaining a well-performing network configuration without human manual intervention. Firstly, we conducted detailed testing on the top four performing neural networks for object recognition in satellite imagery to compare their performance: FastFCN, DeepLabv3, UNET, and MACU. Then we applied and further developed a Neural Architecture Search technique for the best-performing manually designed MACU by optimizing a search space at the artificial neuron cellular level of the network. Several NAS-MACU versions were explored and evaluated. Our developed AutoML process generated a NAS-MACU neural network that produced better performance compared with MACU, especially in a low-information intensity environment. The experimental investigation was performed on our annotated and updated publicly available satellite imagery dataset. We can state that the application of the Neural Architecture Search procedure has the capability to be applied across various datasets and object recognition problems within the remote sensing research field."

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR), a technique to increase the resolution of images, is a pre-processing step in the pipelines of applications of Earth observation (EO) data. The manual design and optimisation of SR models that are specific to every possible EO use case is a laborious process that creates a bottleneck for EO analysis. In this work, we develop an automated machine learning (AutoML) method to automate the creation of dataset-specific SR models. AutoML is the study of the automatic design of high-performance machine learning models. We present the following contributions. (i) We propose AutoSR4EO, an AutoML method for automatically constructing neural networks for SR. We design a search space based on state-of-the-art residual neural networks for SR and incorporate transfer learning. Our search space is extendable, making it possible to adapt AutoSR4EO to future developments in the field. (ii) We introduce a new real-world single-image SR (SISR) dataset, called SENT-NICFI. (iii) We evaluate the performance of AutoSR4EO on four different datasets against the performance of four state-of-the-art baselines and a vanilla AutoML SR method, with AutoSR4EO achieving the highest average ranking. Our results show that AutoSR4EO performs consistently well over all datasets, demonstrating that AutoML is a promising method for improving SR techniques for EO images."

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has great influence on large parts of science and increasingly established itself as an adaptive method for new challenges in the field of Earth observation (EO). Nevertheless, the entry barriers for EO researchers are high due to the dense and rapidly developing field mainly driven by advances in computer vision (CV). To lower the barriers for researchers in EO, this review gives an overview of the evolution of DL with a focus on image segmentation and object detection in convolutional neural networks (CNN). The survey starts in 2012, when a CNN set new standards in image recognition, and lasts until late 2019. Thereby, we highlight the connections between the most important CNN architectures and cornerstones coming from CV in order to alleviate the evaluation of modern DL models. Furthermore, we briefly outline the evolution of the most popular DL frameworks and provide a summary of datasets in EO. By discussing well performing DL architectures on these datasets as well as reflecting on advances made in CV and their impact on future research in EO, we narrow the gap between the reviewed, theoretical concepts from CV and practical application in EO."

    "abstract": "In Earth observation (EO), large-scale land-surface dynamics are traditionally analyzed by investigating aggregated classes. The increase in data with a very high spatial resolution enables investigations on a fine-grained feature level which can help us to better understand the dynamics of land surfaces by taking object dynamics into account. To extract fine-grained features and objects, the most popular deep-learning model for image analysis is commonly used: the convolutional neural network (CNN). In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of deep learning on EO applications by reviewing 429 studies on image segmentation and object detection with CNNs. We extensively examine the spatial distribution of study sites, employed sensors, used datasets and CNN architectures, and give a thorough overview of applications in EO which used CNNs. Our main finding is that CNNs are in an advanced transition phase from computer vision to EO. Upon this, we argue that in the near future, investigations which analyze object dynamics with CNNs will have a significant impact on EO research. With a focus on EO applications in this Part II, we complete the methodological review provided in Part I."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing techniques are becoming more sophisticated as radar imaging techniques mature. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can now provide high-resolution images for day-and-night earth observation. Detecting objects in SAR images is increasingly playing a significant role in a series of applications. In this paper, we address an edge detection problem that applies to scenarios with ship-like objects, where the detection accuracy and efficiency must be considered together. The key to ship detection lies in feature extraction. To efficiently extract features, many existing studies have proposed lightweight neural networks by pruning well-known models in the computer vision field. We found that although different baseline models have been tailored, a large amount of computation is still required. In order to achieve a lighter neural network-based ship detector, we propose Darts_Tiny, a novel differentiable neural architecture search model, to design dedicated convolutional neural networks automatically. Darts_Tiny is customized from Darts. It prunes superfluous operations to simplify the search model and adopts a computation-aware search process to enhance the detection efficiency. The computation-aware search process not only integrates a scheme cutting down the number of channels on purpose but also adopts a synthetic loss function combining the cross-entropy loss and the amount of computation. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate Darts_Tiny on two open datasets, HRSID and SSDD. Experimental results demonstrate that our neural networks win by at least an order of magnitude in terms of model complexity compared with SOTA lightweight models. A representative model obtained from Darts_Tiny (158 KB model volume, 28 K parameters and 0.58 G computations) yields a faster detection speed such that more than 750 frames per second (800\u00d7800 SAR images) could be achieved when testing on a platform equipped with an Nvidia Tesla V100 and an Intel Xeon Platinum 8260. The lightweight neural networks generated by Darts_Tiny are still competitive in detection accuracy: the F1 score can still reach more than 83 and 90, respectively, on HRSID and SSDD."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging holds significant promise in remote sensing applications, particularly for land cover and land-use classification, thanks to its ability to capture rich spectral information. However, leveraging hyperspectral data for accurate segmentation poses critical challenges, including the curse of dimensionality and the scarcity of ground truth data, that hinder the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning approaches. This paper presents a holistic approach for adaptive optimized hyperspectral-based land cover and land-use segmentation using automated machine learning (AutoML). We address the challenges of high-dimensional hyperspectral data through a revamped machine learning pipeline, thus emphasizing feature engineering tailored to hyperspectral classification tasks. We propose a framework that dissects feature engineering into distinct steps, thus allowing for comprehensive model generation and optimization. This framework incorporates AutoML techniques to streamline model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and data versioning, thus ensuring robust and reliable segmentation results. Our empirical investigation demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in automating feature engineering and optimizing model performance, even without extensive ground truth data. By integrating automatic optimization strategies into the segmentation workflow, our approach offers a systematic, efficient, and scalable solution for hyperspectral-based land cover and land-use classification."

    "abstract": "In agriculture, manuring offers several benefits, which include improving soil fertility by adding essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It enhances soil structure, promoting better water retention and aeration, which positively impacts plant growth. Additionally, manuring can suppress certain plant diseases and pests, contributing to healthier crops. However, improper handling and application of manure can pose risks, such as the spread of pathogens and water pollution. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to follow proper storage and composting practices, but also to observe correct application periods and techniques. Spaceborne Earth observation can contribute to monitor manuring, which helps mapping possible derived risks; however, manure detection from satellite data is still an open problem. The aim of this research work is an automated, Machine Learning (ML-)based approach, to detecting manure application on crop fields in time sequences of space-borne, multi-spectral optical Earth Observation data. Among a group of different spectral indexes extracted from multispectral satellite acquisitions, those most impacted by manure application have been identified, and used to train and test various Machine Learning models. This led to discover that the spectral signature of manure application learnt from the concerned training data cannot be easily transferred to different contexts. On the other hand, integrating thermal data allows to improve accuracy, despite possible thermal to multi-spectral sampling mismatch in time series. The addition of radar data offered instead no significant contribution to system performances. The identified method is the first step towards large-scale, consistent monitoring of manure application to check compliance with environmental regulations."

    "abstract": "The incorporation of autonomous computation and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into smart agriculture concepts is becoming an expected scientific procedure. The airborne hyperspectral system with its vast area coverage, high spectral resolution, and varied narrow-band selection is an excellent tool for crop physiological characteristics and yield prediction. However, the extensive and redundant three-dimensional (3D) cube data processing and computation have made the popularization of this tool a challenging task. This research integrated two important open-sourced systems (R and Python) combined with automated hyperspectral narrowband vegetation index calculation and the state-of-the-art AI-based automated machine learning (AutoML) technology to estimate yield and biomass, based on three crop categories (spring wheat, pea and oat mixture, and spring barley with red clover) with multifunctional cultivation practices in northern Europe and Estonia. Our study showed the estimated capacity of the empirical AutoML regression model was significant. The best coefficient of determination (R2) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) for single variety planting wheat were 0.96 and 0.12 respectively; for mixed peas and oats, they were 0.76 and 0.18 in the booting to heading stage, while for mixed legumes and spring barley, they were 0.88 and 0.16 in the reproductive growth stages. In terms of straw mass estimation, R2 was 0.96, 0.83, and 0.86, and NRMSE was 0.12, 0.24, and 0.33 respectively. This research contributes to, and confirms, the use of the AutoML framework in hyperspectral image analysis to increase implementation flexibility and reduce learning costs under a variety of agricultural resource conditions. It delivers expert yield and straw mass valuation two months in advance before harvest time for decision-makers. This study also highlights that the hyperspectral system provides economic and environmental benefits and will play a critical role in the construction of sustainable and intelligent agriculture techniques in the upcoming years."

However, existing methods for SM estimation encounter significant challenges related to accuracy, generalizability, and automation. This study proposes an integrated data fusion method to systematically assess the potential of three automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks\u2014tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT), AutoGluon, and H2O AutoML\u2014in retrieving SM. To evaluate the impact of input variables on estimation accuracy, six input scenarios were designed: multispectral data (MS), thermal infrared data (TIR), MS combined with TIR, MS with auxiliary data, TIR with auxiliary data, and a comprehensive combination of MS, TIR, and auxiliary data. The research was conducted in a winter wheat cultivation area within the People\u2019s Victory Canal Irrigation Area, focusing on the 0\u201340 cm soil layer. The results revealed that the scenario incorporating all data types (MS + TIR + auxiliary) achieved the highest retrieval accuracy. Under this scenario, all three AutoML frameworks demonstrated optimal performance. AutoGluon demonstrated superior performance in most scenarios, particularly excelling in the MS + TIR + auxiliary data scenario. It achieved the highest retrieval accuracy with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) value of 0.822, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.038 cm3/cm3, and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 16.46%. This study underscores the critical role of input data types and fusion strategies in enhancing SM estimation accuracy and highlights the significant advantages of AutoML frameworks for regional-scale SM retrieval. The findings offer a robust technical foundation and theoretical guidance for advancing precision irrigation management and efficient SM monitoring."

    "abstract": "Soil moisture is a critical parameter that significantly impacts the global energy balance, including the hydrologic cycle, land\u2013atmosphere interactions, soil evaporation, and plant growth. Currently, soil moisture is typically measured by installing sensors in the ground or through satellite remote sensing, with data retrieval facilitated by reanalysis models such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). However, the suitability of these methods for capturing local-scale variabilities is insufficiently validated, particularly in regions like South Korea, where land surfaces are highly complex and heterogeneous. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have shown promising potential for soil moisture retrieval at the local scale but have rarely demonstrated substantial products for spatially continuous grids. This paper presents the retrieval of daily soil moisture (SM) over a 500 m grid for croplands in South Korea using random forest (RF) and automated machine learning (AutoML) models, leveraging satellite images and meteorological data. In a blind test conducted for the years 2013\u20132019, the AutoML-based SM model demonstrated optimal performance, achieving a root mean square error of 2.713% and a correlation coefficient of 0.940. Furthermore, the performance of the AutoML model remained consistent across all the years and months, as well as under extreme weather conditions, indicating its reliability and stability. Comparing the soil moisture data derived from our AutoML model with the reanalysis data from sources such as the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), GLDAS, the Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS), and ERA5 for the South Korea region reveals that our AutoML model provides a much better representation. These experiments confirm the feasibility of AutoML-based SM retrieval, particularly for local agrometeorological applications in regions with heterogeneous land surfaces like South Korea."

Recently, Traor\u00e9 et al. have proposed the framework of Fitness Landscape Footprint to help describe and compare neural architecture search problems. It attempts at describing why a search strategy might be successful, struggle or fail on a target task. Our study leverages this methodology in the context of searching across sensors, including sensor data fusion. In particular, we apply the Fitness Landscape Footprint to the real-world image classification problem of So2Sat LCZ42, in order to identify the most beneficial sensor to our neural network hyper-parameter optimization problem. From the perspective of distributions of fitness, our findings indicate a similar behaviour of the CNN search space for all sensors: the longer the training time, the larger the overall fitness, and more flatness in the landscapes (less ruggedness and deviation). Regarding sensors, the better the fitness they enable (Sentinel-2), the better the search trajectories (smoother, higher persistence). Results also indicate very similar search behaviour for sensors that can be decently fitted by the search space (Sentinel-2 and fusion).\n                    "

This article surveys the current state of the art in the fast-moving field of deep learning for time series classification and extrinsic regression. We review different network architectures and training methods used for these tasks and discuss the challenges and opportunities when applying deep learning to time series data. We also summarize two critical applications of time series classification and extrinsic regression, human activity recognition and satellite earth observation."

    "abstract": "Data from Earth observation (EO) satellites are increasingly used to monitor the environment, understand variability and change, inform evaluations of climate model forecasts, and manage natural resources. Policymakers are progressively relying on the information derived from these datasets to make decisions on mitigating and adapting to climate change. These decisions should be evidence based, which requires confidence in derived products, as well as the reference measurements used to calibrate, validate, or inform product development. In support of the European Union\u2019s Earth Observation Programmes Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the Quality Assurance for Essential Climate Variables (QA4ECV) project fulfilled a gap in the delivery of climate quality satellite-derived datasets, by prototyping a generic system for the implementation and evaluation of quality assurance (QA) measures for satellite-derived ECV climate data record products. The project demonstrated the QA system on six new long-term, climate quality ECV data records for surface albedo, leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and carbon monoxide (CO). The provision of standardised QA information provides data users with evidence-based confidence in the products and enables judgement on the fitness-for-purpose of various ECV data products and their specific applications."

    "abstract": "While novel artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are evolving and disrupting established terrestrial technologies at an unprecedented speed, their adaptation onboard satellites is seemingly lagging. A major hindrance in this regard is the need for high-quality annotated data for training such systems, which makes the development process of machine learning solutions costly, time-consuming, and inefficient. This paper presents \u201cthe OPS-SAT case\u201d, a novel data-centric competition that seeks to address these challenges. The powerful computational capabilities of the European Space Agency\u2019s OPS-SAT satellite are utilized to showcase the design of machine learning systems for space by using only the small amount of available labeled data, relying on the widely adopted and freely available open-source software. The generation of a suitable dataset, design and evaluation of a public data-centric competition, and results of an onboard experimental campaign by using the competition winners\u2019 machine learning model directly on OPS-SAT are detailed. The results indicate that adoption of open standards and deployment of advanced data augmentation techniques can retrieve meaningful onboard results comparatively quickly, simplifying and expediting an otherwise prolonged development period."

    "abstract": "Classifying and segmenting patterns from a limited number of examples is a significant challenge in remote sensing and earth observation due to the difficulty in acquiring accurately labeled data in large quantities. Previous studies have shown that meta-learning, which involves episodic training on query and support sets, is a promising approach. However, there has been little attention paid to direct fine-tuning techniques. This paper repurposes contrastive learning as a pre-training method for few-shot learning for classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce a generator-based contrastive learning framework (GenCo) that pre-trains backbones and simultaneously explores variants of feature samples. In fine-tuning, the auxiliary generator can be used to enrich limited labeled data samples in feature space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving few-shot learning performance on two key remote sensing datasets: Agriculture-Vision and EuroSAT. Empirically, our approach outperforms purely supervised training on the nearly 95,000 images in Agriculture-Vision for both classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Similarly, the proposed few-shot method achieves better results on the land-cover classification task on EuroSAT compared to the results obtained from fully supervised model training on the dataset."

    "abstract": "Abstract. Floods are the most frequent, costliest natural disasters having devastating consequences on people, infrastructure, and the ecosystem. During flood events near real-time satellite imagery has proven to be an efficient management tool for disaster management authorities. However one of the challenges is accurate classification and segmentation of flooded water. The generalization ability of binary segmentation using threshold split-based method, is limited due to the effects of backscatter, geographical area, and time of image collection. Recent advancements in deep learning algorithms for image segmentation has demonstrated excellent potential for improving flood detection. However, there have been limited studies in this domain due to the lack of large scale labeled flood event dataset. In this paper, we present two deep learning approaches, first using a UNet and second, using a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), both based on a backbone of EfficientNet-B7, by leveraging publicly available Sentinel-1 dataset provided jointly by NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team, and IEEE GRSS Earth Science Informatics Technical Committee. The dataset covers flood events from Nebraska, North Alabama, Bangladesh, Red River North, and Florence. The performances of both networks were evaluated with multiple training, testing, and validation. During testing, the UNet model achieved the meanIOU score of 75.06% and the FPN model achieved the meanIOU score of 75.76%.\n                    "
